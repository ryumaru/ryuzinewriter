Version 1.0
===========

	THEMES
	* Themes now support “child” themes
	* Separate theme files for Ryuzine Writer and Reader/Rack/Press
	* Ryuzine Writer now sets a unique cookie for theme options so
	  Writer, and Reader/Rack on the same server do not share prefs.
	* All older Android themes have been retired, the new “Paperbot”
	  theme is now the preferred platform theme for Android.
	* Original “Mobile Fruit” theme replaced by “Mobile Fruit 7” and
	  updated for iOS 8.x look and feel.
	* “Dark” and “Light” styling moved from UI stylesheet to themes
	* New “Writer” theme with tabbed UI (can also be used as a base
	  for other tabbed child themes).

	RYUZINE READER
	* Updated and simplified User Interface:
	  * no more sliding through multiple tab bars, all controls up front
	  * Improved swipe detection for phones in portrait orientation (tap
	    left/right edge is also now available), which makes using Ryuzine
	    easier to use when UI bars are hidden.
	  * default position of panels is to slide in from sides (can be changed
	    by themes)
	  * “Help” button moved to “Contents” panels (where it should be)
	  * All icon images replaced by icon font
	  * “Done” buttons on panels positioned to edges of screen to make
	    it easier to tap them on tablets.
	  * Themes should now focus on color and style instead of attempting
	    to mimic native UI elements.  If you mimic native UI the end user
	    expects the webapp to behave like a native app, which it won’t.  
	    Third-party themes should instead be focused on just looking nice 
	    over looking like any specific OS platform UI.  The config option
	    for OS Theme Targeting is still in place, so you can selectively
	    send color themes to different platforms designed to compliment
	    (rather than mimic) that platform. 
	  * IE 10+ missing Splash text now fixed (as well as DOM error it caused) 
	* Shift+F4 now opens the Options Panel (it had no keys assigned to it, oops!)
	* Splash Ad (if set) now offer reader ability to “Skip Ad”
	* Banner Ad config settings are now consistent with other integrated ads.
	* Most of the “skeuomorphic” page effects have been moved from the binding
	  stylesheets into the “Page Curves” add-on, allowing for a cleaner, more
	  modern, minimalist appearance (page shadows remain a separate effect).
	* Integrated Banner Ad fixed so it no longer ends up with two “Close” buttons
	  when file is subsequently edited Ryuzine Writer.
	* You can now include an <img> tag within your #splash_title and it will
	  replace the title text in the mobile (phone) nav bar.
	* Loading spinner is now CSS3 powered icon font instead of animated GIF.
	* NEW default Social Share Widget utilizes URL Parameters.  Unlike many of
	  the social network widgets this one does NOT create or load IFRAME elements
	  that can delay the loading of the publication.  The default share widget was
	  also broken out into an add-on to make customization (or complete replacement)
	  much easier.  We think this new widget meets the needs of most users enough
	  that there’s no need to replace it. However, if you want to use another widget 	  you still can do so either within the HTML or by replacing the default script.
	* Options Switches simplified for easier theme customization:
		* reduced to 2 HTML elements (was 8)
		* More CSS3 control of appearance/animations from themes
		* .opt-disabled now applies to the <LI> tag, so themes can
		  easily style the list item, label, and/or switch differntly
		  to best indicate to users that an option is disabled.
	* 2D binding stylesheets removed as nobody should still be using a version
	  of Chrome prior to 19 or pre-Blink Opera browsers anymore.
	* On phones in landscape orientation the page content now stretches from
	  the top to bottom (header and footer are hidden) because it is likely
	  users will hide the UI anyway, given the limited space.
	* Failure to load localization script no longer stops webapp.
	* Localization updated (“About” app now also localizes)
	* Theme detection fixed (so Options no longer show theme enabled when none
	  is actually loaded - happened when window URL included #anchor link)
	* If a theme swaps the positions of the NavBar and TabBar the script now
	  swaps the banner ad and the TOC Slider (swaps back if theme is disabled)
	* ApplicationCache removed.
	* “Show All Dialogs” added to Options Panel.  If there are dialogs with a
	  “Do not show this again” checkbox the user can choose to hide them.  To
	  over-ride dialogs previously set to hide and see them anyway you turn 
	  this switch on and all dialogs - regardless of hide settings - will be
	  shown (in case you hid one by accident or changed your mind, when it is
	  again visible you can un-tick the box to make it show, then turn off all
	  other dialogs you meant to hide by flipping the option switch to “off.”
	* Files unique to the webapp are now in a “ryuzine”sub-folder to prevent
	  authors overwriting or deleting them, and make it easier to drop in
	  future backwards-compatible updates.  This is also now consistent with
	  how the Ryuzine Press plugin already uses the webapp.
	* Escape from dialogs with ESC key (closes all open dialogs)
	* Up/Down arrows now also do back/next page, because in continuous or
	  plain HTML view they are vertically scrolling and it wasn’t obvious
	  that the left/right would move you up/down through the page sections.
	* Font > Color Sepia/Black no longer attempts to override author’s intent
	  when custom styling has been specified, it now only overrides the default
	  styling.

	RYUZINE RACK
	* Same UI fixes as Ryuzine Reader
	* Fixed issue where you could only swap to another catalog once and
	  then could not change to another or back to the original catalog.
	* Fixed issue with Sort Panel catalog switch buttons losing events
	  until the browser had a resize/reorientation event
	* Fixed issue with Sort Panel buttons getting multiple copies of the
	  same event listener attached, causing the target function to fire
	  dozens of times on one click.
	* Appearance of Auto-generated Promos improved to make them look more
	  like advertisements and different from the Item Details. 
	* Now supports global “app logo” to appear in Navbar
	* If “masthead” is included in catalog it appears in Navbar (and will
	  over-ride any existing app logo)  This allows individual catalogs to
	  change the “branding” on the Newsstand.  If you switch to a catalog
	  without a masthead the original app logo OR app title will be restored
	  to the Navbar.
	* UI updated to new format
	* Bookmarking button background-size fixed for high-density displays
	* “Find” button now only appears in the alternate (list) modes, since
	  it does not work in “grid” view anyway.
	* Item links changed to prevent misfires on touch devices (everything runs
	  through tapCheck function now).
	* Default changed to open publications in new tab/window (_blank) rather
	  than in the same window/tab as Ryuzine Rack itself.
	* Code for legacy link targeting removed
	* Add/Remove item from Reading List no longer requires page refresh to 
	  see that it has been marked/unmarked (shows up immediately now).
	* Theme detection fixed (so Options no longer show theme enabled when none
	  is actually loaded - happened when window URL included #anchor link)
	* ApplicationCache removed.
	* Banner Ad config settings are now consistent with other integrated ads.
	* Page X of X footer removed, Navbar counter restyled to appear below spinner
	  during page changes on small screen devices.
	* Views stylesheet media queries had different break-points than main ui
	  stylesheet which are now fixed.
	* “Simple” and “Detail” list styling has minor layout fixes.
	* If the “In App” option is in use the “Drop Bar” no longer shows thumbnails
	  of items on the Reading List - these have been moved to a slide-in Panel
	  using the same UI/thumbnails as the mobile version of Ryuzine Rack, and now
	  allows management of the Reading List while a publication is open in the app.
	* Files unique to the webapp are now in a “ryuzine”sub-folder to prevent
	  authors overwriting or deleting them, and make it easier to drop in
	  future backwards-compatible updates.  This is also now consistent with
	  how the Ryuzine Press plugin already uses the webapp.
	* Escape from dialogs with ESC key (closes all open dialogs)
	* Font > Color Sepia/Black no longer attempts to override author’s intent
	  when custom styling has been specified, it now only overrides the default
	  styling.
	* Fixed problem where whitespace in promo column was misread as possible image
	  which would throw “Error 400: Bad Request” in promo carousel.
	* Fixed issue with promo carousel where it only worked properly with one,
	  three, or five promos and additional promos would be stacked on top of
	  each other.  Minimum for animated carousel is now 3 promos, preferred is 5.
	* Setting maxpromos to 0 (zero) now fully disables the carousel and hides the 
	  Options Panel > Featured Items switch.
	* You no longer need to define the image paths in the config file.  It will now
	  always look in the /images/rack/ subfolder but there are two important changes:
		1. The old standard and high resolution system has been scrapped.
		   Simply supply ALL devices with 300px wide cover art images.
		2. Cover art images must be in subfolders matching the filename of the
		   catalog to which they belong.  For example, the default catalog is
		   “catalog1.htm” so the corresponding cover art image folder would be:
		   /images/rack/catalog1/
	  This prevents you from having cover art for multiple catalogs mixed together in
	  the one “rack” image folder.  They are now organized in subfolders.

	RYUZINE WRITER
	* Save dialog now prevents you from accidentally saving HTML file that
	  overwrites Ryuzine Writer itself or Ryuzine Rack.
	* Fixed Scan Directory issue with showing files that should have been
	  hidden in the Open and Package dialogs.
	* Simulator completely rewritten to:
		* Make creating device profiles easier
		* Allow Add-Ons to append custom devices profiles
		* “Add Device” dialog updated for new method
		* Operating System elements now independent of device profiles
		* Ability to add custom operating system profiles
		* Automatically prefers “Portrait” orientation for phones and
		  “Landscape” for tablet profiles on switching devices
		* “Fill View” now uses a dropbar control like Ryuzine Rack’s “In-App” view.
	* Fixed Ryu Picker header and page element creation “undefined” error.
	* ALL Editor panels can now be undocked and float
	* Floating editor panels cannot be dragged off screen
	* Floating editor panels now travel with Editor Workspace
	* Removed Fullscreen Editor mode because it effectively disables floating
	  editor panels and other editor dialogs appeared underneath it.  ESC key
	  to get out of fullscreen mode failed intermittently (trapping you in
	  fullscreen mode).
	* Package Builder > Custom now lets you pick which custom web font folders or
	  loose fonts to include in the package.  “Smallest Package” includes none,
	  “Standard Package” copies the entire /fonts folder.
	* Package Builder > Custom now has a checkbox to explicitly preserve the Xinha
	  Editor “thumbs” folder, otherwise it is always removed to reduce file size.
	  It is therefore NOT recommended that you put your own thumbnails in that folder
	  or a folder with that name if you are not using “Custom” packaging.
	* Package Builder now allows building packages with JUST Ryuzine Rack inside.
	* Package Builder allows you to select specific catalog files and catalog image
	  subfolders in the same way as you can pick and choose which addons or themes
	  will be included in a custom package.
	* Package Builder now allows you to select specific fonts (both organized in subfolders
	  and loose fonts) to include in custom packages.
	* No longer asks you for “Issue specific stylesheet” at load time
		* Can now be set to auto-import Master Styles stylesheet in writer.config.js:
		  	* Set “myStyles = 1”
			* Set “importStyles = “filename.css”
			* User can over-ride in Options Panel “Auto-import Master Styles”
	* “Issue-specific Stylesheet” renamed “Master Styles”
	* “My Styles” panel is now “Master Styles” and you can load/change
	  stylesheets without having to reload Ryuzine Writer.  It also tells
          what stylesheet filename is currently loaded.
	* In-page styles now have their own panel called “Edition Styles” which
	  can Add/Delete styles plus Load/Save external stylesheets.
	* The “Edition Styles” panel also lets you create “Editor Styles” that 
	  customize how objects appear in the Editor window while composing, but
	  these styles are not exported when you build your magazine.  Any class name
          with “editor” in it will be an editor-only style that will not be included
          in your in-page Edition Styles.  This is useful if you want to, for example,
	  color code or outline certain elements within the editor, but do not want them
	  styled that way in the actual Ryuzine webapp or in an ePub export.
	* The “Edition Styles” panel will now also accept simple compound and multiple
	  class declarations from the “Add New Style” dialog (but not all will be imported
	  from an external stylesheet).
		Base Class: .myclass { color: blue; }
		Compound:   .myclass.yourclass.theirclass { color: red;}
		Multiple:   .myclass .yourclass .theirclass { color: purple;}

	The difference between “compound” and “multiple” is that compound redefines what
	happens if a single element has ALL of those classes applied to it.  It is treated
	as a unique new class unto itself, but inherits any undefined rules from the individual
	listed classes.  Multiples denote ancestor-descendant relationships where the first
	class is the oldest ancestor and the last class name is the youngest descendent (which
	means the descendants are nested inside their ancestors).  In this case only the LAST
	class name will inherit undefined rules from the individual class of the same name.

	When you import or create a multiple ancestor-descendant selector the Edition Styles
	panel will divide it and any previously undeclared class names will be added to the
	<style> block as empty declarations. The example above would be written into the
	in-page style block like this:

		.myclass { color: blue;}
		.yourclass {}
		.theirclass {}
		.myclass .yourclass .theirclass { color: purple;}

	This makes sure it is at least possible to apply “.yourclass” and “.theirclass” to
	elements within the editor, but it is up to you - the writer - to make sure that
	you apply the styles to the correct nested ancestor-descendant elements.

	It is also possible to enter compounds like “h1.myheader” (a <h1> tag with class “.myheader”)
	or “h1 .myheader” (a child element inside a <h1> tag with class “.myheader”).  However these
	are currently problematic and should be avoided.  If you intend to style HTML tags you should
	ideally do that in your “Master Styles” external stylesheet, NOT the Edition Styles.

	The “Edition Styles” panel also allows you to select a style or styles from the list and
	DELETE them.  Be aware that deleting a style will ALSO check through all the other styles
	for every reference to the style(s) being deleted and delete them as well!  As an example
	let’s say you defined the following:

		.egg { background-color: yellow;}
		.foo { color: brown;}
		.young { font-size: 12px;}
		.egg.foo.young { font-size: 24px;}
		.egg .foo .young { color: red;}
		.egghead { background-color: beige;}
		.eggbert { border-radius: 8px; }

	If you select “.egg” in the panel list and then the Trash icon it will ask if you want
	to delete “.egg” and every other reference to it?  If you confirm the deletion, afterwards
	your style block would read:
		
		.foo { color: brown; }
		.young { font-size: 12px;}
		.egghead { background-color: beige;}
		.eggbert { border-radius: 8px;}

	Notice that it left “.egghead” and “.eggbert” alone, because they do NOT reference the
	deleted style “.egg” they just have a name with “e-g-g” in them.  But the compound style
	“.egg.foo.young” and the ancestor-descendant style “.egg .foo .young” are both deleted 
	because they rely on the now deleted “.egg” to work, so there’s no point in keeping them
	around.

	* File Manager fixed so it now properly detects files with extension “.jpeg”
	* NEW Page Manager similar to those found in professional page layout software:
		* Add/Delete pages
		* Add Multiple Pages dialog
		* Drag to re-order pages
		* Insert single pages by selection
		* Select/Deselect multiple pages
		* 3 different page thumbnail sizes
		* Display thumbnail image or blank thumbnails (latter improves performance)
		* Display Facing Pages (editor width allowing)
			* Left or Right Bound layout
		* Outline Page Elements
	* “Split” is now “View” and lets you select between:
		* Auto-Split Horizontal or Vertical depending on detected window size
		* Split Vertical top/bottom
		* Split Horizontal left/right
		* Reset View (no split)
	* “Build” now takes you to the Simulator instead of “Export” (because,
	  logically you’d want to see if it worked before exporting it).
	* “Build” now automatically submits the “Output Options” to make sure any
	  custom stylesheets are included in the build (but you should still make
	  sure to double-check the Output Options before you actually Export).
	* Fixed “Sync2Pack” function that tries to synchronize Output Format options
	  and ConfigBuilder options (if used) with Custom Package options in the
	  Package Builder dialog.
	* Package Builder now allows you to make packages with just Ryuzine Rack
	  in them (now you can choose Ryuzine, Ryuzine Rack, or Both).
	* Better support for sharing over social networks
	  * “Summary” element is easily read by bots, also used as meta description
	    either of which is used by SEO and Facebook as excerpt.
	  * “Summary” element can contain an image which is used as thumbnail for
	    Facebook and media for “Pinterest” sharing.
	    Note: this is not set as thumbnail with Open Graph meta because that
	    prevents Facebook users from selecting their own thumbnail on the share.
	    You can put more images in the “Summary” element, however, so Facebook
	    shares only have your suggested thumbnails from which to choose.

	* “Document Properties” panel is new, it lets you define more meta data for
	  your publication and inclusion/exclusion of “unique” elements.
		* From a blank document you can open “File > Properties” and
		  define the “Title,” “Summary,” and what other unique elements
		  you plan to use in your publication.  Hit “Apply” and it will
		  create the elements in the Editor.
		* After you have created or loaded a document you can later
	  	  decide to turn various “unique” elements on or off.  If you
		  disable an element any content that was in it is preserved in
		  a variable (so you can restore it if you made a mistake), but
		  it is only retained until you load something new in the Editor.
		* You can also manually add or delete elements within the Editor
		  and the Document Properties will be updated to reflect the actual
		  contents of the document as it is right now.
		* Summary notes a 155 character limit.  The element can be whatever
		  length you want, but the <meta name=“description” will ignore any
		  characters beyond 155.
		* The Document Properties panel *tries* to identify the File Format
		  of what is loaded into the Editor.  If it is a Ryuzine document 
		  following the new specification it should have a <meta> “generator”
		  tag with the current version number.  However if there is no meta
		  tag it will try to guess what the file format is by the document
		  structure:

			* Ryuzine 0.9.5.x (or earlier) - an old, incompatible format
			* Ryuzine 1.0 (Converted) - a 0.9.6.x file that has no
			  version data, but could be converted to the current spec.
			* Ryuzine 1.0 (Inferred) - a 0.9.6.7+ file that has no
			  version data, but has the structure of the current spec.
			* Ryuzine 1.0 - a current spec file with version data.
			* Version Data Missing - the file has no version data and
			  Ryuzine Writer doesn’t recognize the document structure.
			* Ryuzine Rack - identifies a file, or preview, or a newsstand.

			There is also a box at the bottom titled “Import Notes” that
			tells you more about the file, particularly urging you to re-
			save or rebuild the file if it was converted from one of the
			older structures.
	* BUILD PACKAGE - now limits user to selecting a single images sub-folder and
	  offers the option to skip ZIPping into an archive if you would like to manually
	  add more files and/or use some other archive format.  The folder could also be
	  FTP’d up to a web server directly (saves you the step of unzipping it first).
	* Styling for the Xinha Editor no longer requires a separate “Skin” file, it
	  is now part of the Ryuzine Writer theme file. 


“Edition Styles” Panel Notes:
The panel does not support compound styles or nested styles.  If you load a stylesheet that has any it will alert you that they were found and will not be shown in the panel list.  It only supports simple “dot” selectors like .classname.  Tag elements (like <p> or <h1>, etc.) should have their rules set in your Master Stylesheet.

If you use the “Save Styles” option from the “Editor Styles” panel it will save every selector shown in the panel, including Editor Styles. However, if you use the “Output > Preserve In-Page Styles” and then go to the “Export > HTML” tab the file will not contain the Editor Styles.

NEW DOCUMENT SPECIFICATION
There are still two document formats that can be imported to the editor:

“wip” (work in progress) files are those saved from the editor workspace.  If the file has never been built before these only contain the actual pages of your publication and the “document properties” elements and possibly a link to a custom stylesheet.

“Ryuzine” files are those that have already been built and saved from the “Export” workspace and therefore contain all the additional links to scripts and stylesheets necessary to work as stand-alone Ryuzine publications.  You can still import these processed files into the editor, save them as WIP files or rebuild them with your edits.

These files now should have a div container with the id “issue” inside which exist all the pages of the publication.  The pages are now in the format of:

	<div id=“issue”>
		<div id=“pageX” class=“page”>
			<div class=“header”>Heading</div>
			<div class=“live”>
			… page content …
			</div>
		</div>
	. . . other page divs . . .
	</div>

(If it’s an older file it will automatically be converted to this new layout if possible upon importing it to the Editor)

There are also two other (optional) top-level containers with the ids “front_matter” and “end_matter” which are meant to contain all the “unique” elements.  The only purpose of placing them inside these other containers is so their visibility can be easily toggled on/off in the WYSIWYG editor.  If the unique elements are not inside these containers they simply exist on the “pasteboard” in the editor window.  Ryuzine will still find them and use them regardless of where they are in the document.  Nonetheless the recommended format is:

<div id=“front_matter”>
	<h1 id=“splash_title”>Title of Publication</h1>
	<p id=“summary”>Summary of this issue contents for SEO</p>
	<div id=“splash_screen”>(splash ad link and image)</div>
	<div id=“appbanner”>(mobile style banner ad link & image)</div>
	<div id=“welcome_sign”>Optional greeting message</div>
</div>
<div id=“issue”>
	<div id=“pageX” class=“page”>
		<h1 class=“header”>Page Heading</h1>
		<div class=“live”>
		. . .page content. . .
		</div>	
	</div>
	. . . other page divs . . .
</div>
<div id=“end_matter”>
	<div id=“issue_gallery”>
		<div class=“light_boxed”>lightboxed image</div>
		<p class=“caption”>optional image caption</div>
		. . .additional lightboxed images and captions . . .
	</div>
	<div id=“exit_message”>Optional exit messages</div>
	<div id=“social_widget”>if you want to use your own social/sharing widget</div>
	<div id=“offline”>optional URL of your site or this publication</div>
	<div id=“copy_right”>optional copyright notice</div>
</div>

Again, all the elements inside of both “front_matter” and “end_matter” are optional, you can put them in any order you want and they technically don’t even need to be in either of those containers (but you won’t be able to hide them in the editor if you don’t put them in those containers).

You can have other stuff in your document, for example to target SEO bots or for people with JS and CSS disabled, but anything other than those specific elements noted above gets discarded when the document is converted to Ryuzine by the Reader scripts.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
* If you manually add or delete pages in the rich-text editor Ryuzine Writer will attempt to rectify any disparity between the Page Manager thumbnails and the actual pages in the editor.  If you failed to properly close any quotes or tags this will throw a JS error, which doesn’t halt the program but it will keep throwing errors until you go into HTML edit mode and fix your code (the editor will TRY to fix the code, but may not wrap elements with your intent).

Version 0.9.6.5-b
=================

THEMES
* minor fixes to Urban theme
* minor fixes to Coolbeans theme
* NEW iOS7-inspired theme

RYUZINE READER
* Support for iScroll 5 Beta
* Better apply/remove of scrolling method to panels (no longer requires refreshing
	browser for the new setting to take effect)
* Simpler anchor linking to other page sections from within body text of a page (no longer need to include any javascript or event handlers)
* Lightbox Links now create lightbox button as an <a> element (needed for IE10+ using iScroll 5)
* Pages Scroller control now supports a progress indicator in the track


RYUZINE WRITER
* Now includes addons for iScroll 5 Beta and ePub generation
* Simulator skins updated to allow custom styling of simulated UI elements
* Fixed Add-Ons error that caused "More >" button to not be created if
  there were more than two add-ons loaded that created custom workspaces.


Version 0.9.6.4-b
=================

RYUZINE RACK
* Added option for link targeting.  For example if you set it to "1" the buttons open the content in a new window.
* Fixed display of info cards in Firefox.
* Updated for new language code implementation.
* Fixed About Dialog box missing images error.
* Fixed error that disabled iScroll if either Zoom & Pan or Native Scrolling were also disabled.
* Fixed missing cover thumbnails in Reading List

RYUZINE WRITER
* Configuration Builder updated to include the new link targeting option for Ryuzine Rack.
* Configuration Builder updated for new language localization support, removal of Country Code option.

URBAN THEME
* Fixed display of Lightbox gallery content centering across browsers.
* Fixed missing page buttons on Ryuzine Rack

LOCALIZATION ADD-ON
* Added support for 10 new languages.  Removed necessity to declare a country code (if you are using an old config file that still declares one it is simply ignored).

RYUZINE READER
* Fixed display of Lightbox gallery content for Firefox (worked ok in WebKit, but not Mozilla).
* Updated for new language code implementation.

Opera 12.15+ users are no longer offered the choice of "Plain HTML" or "Webapp" views.  The webapp mostly works again in Opera, but not well enough to say it's supported, and we have no plans to even try specifically supporting Opera again until after a desktop Webkit/Blink version is available for testing.


Version 0.9.6.3-b


* Internet Explorer 8 and earlier
* Safari 3.0 and earlier
* webOS devices
* BlackBerry devices

UNSUPPORTED
Internet Explorer 8 and earlier, Safari 3 and earlier are now officially "unsupported."  Opera browsers were dropped from support a while ago, but there are some versions of Opera that do (or mostly) work so Ryuzine now detects for Opera and offers users the option to either view a plain HTML version or try to run the Ryuzine webapp with a warning that there are "known problems" so there is not expectation that it will work properly.

The "Legacy Support" add-on (aka Robert Nyman's "getElementsByClassName" script) is deprecated now that Ryuzine no longer accommodates legacy Internet Explorer or Safari browsers.

LIMITED SUPPORT
These browsers cannot show the page-flip animation properly if at all anyway, so they are now default to Page Animations = Off
*Chrome 2.x
*Safari 3.12
*Internet Explorer 9
*Firefox 3.6
* Android 2.x
* Windows Phone 7.5

There have been significant issues with Android 2.x since the original version of Ryuzine, mostly related to bugs in the built-in browser regarding how it renders (or often doesn't) the CSS3 transform effects upon which Ryuzine is based.  Because there are still a significant number of Android 2.x devices in use they are still supported, but that support is limited due to the buggy nature of the browser.  What does this "limited" support mean?
* No page-flipping "Magazine" mode
* No Grid View thumbnail navigation mode
* No native scrolling mode
* Browser User Agent String must be set to "Android"
* Seriously "low-end" devices may not be usable at all (but try "Continuous" or "HTML Only" views first)

Support in Windows Phone 7.5 is also "limited" because the Internet Explorer Mobile browser is based on Internet Explorer 9.  Windows Phone also does not understand the WebKit touch events used in Ryuzine so the "swipe" gesture doesn't turn the pages (there are proprietary Microsoft touch events but they have not yet been added to Ryuzine).

SUPPORTED
*Chrome 20
*Safari 4
* Firefox 4
* iOS 4
* Android 4

UNTESTED
We are no longer testing Ryuzine in webOS/openWebOs, BlackBerry, Firefox Mobile, or pretty much anything else we haven't mentioned.  That doesn't mean Ryuzine won't work on those platforms, it means we don't know whether it does or not and are no longer making any special accommodations for them or, obviously, any other platforms we haven't mentioned.

Windows Phone 8 has also not been tested, however Ryuzine doesn't use any of the Internet Explorer 10 features which are disabled in the mobile version so everything, aside from the swipe gesture, should work.

RYUZINE READER
Eliminated nearly 500 lines of code with the removal/change of which platforms and browsers Ryuzine will now support.  It's only 4KB but most of it was made up of complex, nested alternatives depending on the browser/platform that no longer have to be processed.

Automatic updating of old-format Ryuzine files is now handled differently.  The page is rewritten first to the new format and then processed like any new format file would be.  Known problems with the auto-update:

* Pages may be blank until you force a rebinding event either by resizing the window or changing the orientation of the device (this seems specific to webkit browsers, Firefox and IE did not do this).
* If the lightbox links use something other than index numbers as targets they'll be broken
* Old format Ryuzine files can now be imported into the Ryuzine Writer editor

* Fixed issue with splash title using a banner image rather than text also being placed in footers.  Now detects for image as splash title and uses the title tag text in footers if that is the case.
* Fixed double page turn-back error in phone landscape view
* Fixed iScroll injection on auto-updated files.  Check for iScroll is now done later for all documents and should prevent iScroll initialization problems.
* Fixed addition/removal of mouse/touch events to pages
* Fixed page scrolling length error when Page Animations are disabled

* VIEWS now have keyboard shortcuts for desktop users:
	CTRL+L = Continuous/Linear
	CTRL+G = Grid View
	CTRL+H = HTML Only
	CTRL+M = Magazine (default)

* App always scrolls to the top of content now after a View change (problem was content could be already out of view and inaccessible)
* Fixed positioning error in Firefox when returning to Magazine View from Grid View
* Disabled Pages Slider for Windows Phone 7 (touch controls for it didn't work anyway)
* Disabled iScroll for Windows Phone 7 (it used to show in Options but had no effect whether turned on or off)
* Enabled iScroll for Internet Explorer 9 and 10 (used to cause layout errors so it was disabled)
* Fixed UI rendering errors with buttons and lists in Firefox 18+


RYUZINE WRITER

* Now supports importing old "processed" Ryuzine files for editing
* Added Keyboard Shortcuts for switching between workspaces
* Added "Loading" animated icon on start-up
* Template Wizard now has settings for building Webcomic templates
	- select Manga binding
	- "contain" fitting option
	- auto-generates CSS and HTML
	- option to create template and build publication in one go
* Fix to simulated publication in Firefox 13+
* Fixed missing layouts for right-bound Packaged publications
* Packaging wizard drop-down lists for Server source files now synced with Output Options
* Packaging wizard "Custom" section now lists add-ons and themes by the actual folder names and
   builds the lists by checking the actual folder contents first (so you cannot accidentally declare an
   add-on or theme that is not available to be included in the package).
* Automatic conversion on import of files created with Adobe InDesign
	* Import files created with Export for Dreamweaver
	* Import files created with Structure > Export XML
* File Operations updated to check if directory is writable first
* NEW "Add On" system for extending Ryuzine Writer
	* Easily add your own start buttons, dialog boxes, option switches, and entire workspaces
	* Chain-load add-ons (i.e., add-on can load other add-ons)
	* Create add-on packages that auto-install a corresponding script or stylesheet for Ryuzine Reader
* Navigation and Tab Bars updated to support new add-on extensions.
* RyuPicker plugin updated, can now wrap both text and images in Ryuzine elements (previously only would do text selections)
* RyuPicker plugin now asks for a unique ID for lightboxed elements (previous versions required you to place all lightbox elements in a specific order to make sure they were assigned the correct index numbers as an ID, and lightbox links could only refer to them by numerical index.  This version now allows you to set and target by any alphanumeric ID and place the lightboxed content in any order you please).
