/* 	Ryuzine Writer OS Skins		

	This stylesheet loads the on-screen
	operating system elements such as the
	mobile device status bar, browser bar,
	tab/system bar and their typical sizes.
	
	You can over-ride any or all of these 
	with custom styles in your device skin.
	
	If you want to add new os layouts put
	them in a sub-folder and import them
	into this stylesheet below.  You can
	also comment out operating systems you
	do not want to include, or ones that
	have become obsolete.
